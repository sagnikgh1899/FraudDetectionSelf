"""
This script implements the LOF (Local Outlier Factor) using PyOD library to detect anomalies.
LOF is an unsupervised outlier detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point
with respect to its neighbors. It considers as outliers the samples that have a substantially lower density than
their neighbors.

    Detects anomalies in the input data using the LOF algorithm.

    Parameters:
        data (pandas.DataFrame or numpy.ndarray): Input data to be analyzed.
        contamination (float): Proportion of outliers in the data.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: A boolean array indicating whether each data point is an outlier or not.
